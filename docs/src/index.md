# A TWAI subproject for SWC estimation

Documentation for [TWAISWCF](https://github.com/okatsn/TWAISWCF).

In this project, we investigate the feasibility of using the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm for estimating soil water content (SWC) using commonly available meteorological parameters. 
We trained and validated CART models using data collected in a grassland terrain in northern Taiwan throughout 2018, with the goal of providing precise information for agricultural irrigation and flood risk assessment.

This project is funded by the National Science and Technology Council (R.O.C) through grant number MOST 110-2634-F-008-008.
